The primary objective of a food recommendation system is to increase sales and revenue by encouraging customers to try new menu items and by encouraging repeat business. This can be achieved by analyzing customer data and using machine learning algorithms to understand patterns in customer behavior and preferences, and by presenting recommendations that are tailored to the individual's tastes and needs. By using a food recommendation system, businesses can improve their customer retention rates, increase customer satisfaction, and ultimately drive growth and profitability.\n","\n","2. **How will the solution be used**:\n","The solution will be used in a website application or even a mobile app.\n","3. **How should you frame this problem ( supervised/unsupervised, online/offline,...)**:\n","The problem is an **unsupervised**,**offline** and **a model based learning problem**, since we are building a recommendation model from the whole unlabled data.\n","4. **State of the art projects:**\n","There is a little SOTA projects on food/diet recommendation. Nevertheless, I found a research journal that has pretty much the same idea/objectives of my project.
